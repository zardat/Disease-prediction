# Disease Prediction

Our website has the ability to predict the disease based on the symptoms added by the user on the website. 
The project makes use of neural networks to predict the accurate disease and the libraries pandas and numpy were used excessively for data cleaning. The frontend of the project is created using HTML,CSS and Javascript.

NOTE: Due to server and back-end errors the website couldn't be deployed and is still under progress.
